Nov 19 18:56:44.000 [notice] It looks like I need to generate and sign a new medium-term signing key, because I don't have one. To do that, I need to load (or create) the permanent master identity key. If the master identity key was not moved or encrypted with a passphrase, this will be done automatically and no further action is required. Otherwise, provide the necessary data using 'tor --keygen' to do it manually.
